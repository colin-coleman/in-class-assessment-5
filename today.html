<p>There have always been warnings to not go into the woods in Brazton County. Stories have been told about what lives out there but none of us believed it... until last night. It was just supposed to be a hangout, time away from everyone. We heard rustling in the trees but we thought it was just animals until we saw it. Two glowing green-orange eyes stared at us, then we saw how tall it was... It had metalic armor and just stared, all it did was stare </p>
<p> <strong> Until it glided towards us</strong> </p>
